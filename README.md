# Alzheimer-Data-Analysis
The repository provides an analysis of Alzheimer's disease data collected from mice with 
different genotypes, including c9orf, HLA, GBA, and APOEs. Each genotype had both a breeding 
and non-breeding population. The provided script was used to generate graphs for each genotype, 
depicting the response to nutrition prevention for both the breeding and non-breeding populations. 
The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the effects of nutrition on Alzheimer's disease, 
specifically how different genotypes respond to nutrition prevention. Each folder provides an overview
of the data and analysis methods used, as well as instructions for running the script and reproducing 
the results.
